<h2>Support Denis Sotchenko's PS2M mouse adapter's PIC 
microcontroller firmware</h2>
"ps2mhiiri627" is a small printed circuit board design for an Amiga - PS/2 
mouse adapter. It uses the PIC16F627A 
microcontroller from Microchip. Also any other sufficiently similar PIC 
can be used. The firmware comes from the ps2m project (see links for 
more information). Cadsoft EAGLE 
board and schematic files are on this page for download.
Some of the older revisions
may have hardware bugs, so the new fixed ones should be used.
To use a wheel mouse (scroll) you will need a cable to Amiga's second
joystick port, and a driver utility, WBM (Wheel Bus Mouse.)

<h2>Problem with right (and middle) mouse button</h2>
<h3>POTY/POTX inputs are not normal TTL-inputs</h3>
A problem: The right mouse button is not recognised by a certain A1200 unit
as pressed down, because the voltage at the D-connector pin 9
remains at 0.3 volts. The input is not a normal TTL-input, but it is
used for a resistance-to-digital converter, "POTY", for example
to be used for an analog joystick or paddles. The middle button uses the other 
POT (potentiometer) input.<br>
<a href="http://www.amiga.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=40366&amp;forum=8">
Maybe the problem causes the pics to die eventually.</a><br>
<h3>Possible fix for right mouse button</h3>
Combine three outputs of PIC to drive "POTY".
I used RA6 and RA7 with RB3 to open drain sink current, and
the voltage lowered to 0.16V (on an A500+ mainboard.) Here's
the <a href="http://www.mkl211015.altervista.org/ps2mhiiri627/ps2m-m03a.asm">modified source code</a>, <a href="http://www.mkl211015.altervista.org/ps2mhiiri627/ps2m-m03.hex">
.hex-file.</a> It also has initialisation code for PIC16LF87's internal
oscillator to make it run at 4 MHz. I hope the modifications don't
cause  any side effects. Anyway I tested the adapter with LF87 and it worked, 
and so does it with F627A. Note: This doesn't do anything to the middle mouse 
button.<br>

<h3>Compiling picasm and with picasm</h3>
I downloaded <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">mingw</a> gnu c environment
for windows and mingw-make, added its bin-directory to windows xp search path 
and compiled <a href="http://www.jmp.fi/~trossi/pic/">picasm</a> v1.14. For some 
reason the compiled picasm produced "funny" line feed (or 
similar) codes, Winpic800 couldn't load the hex file. I loaded the hex file with
willem 0.97ja software and saved it back, and then Winpic800 loaded it fine.
(Picasm assembler seems to be available as a precompiled deb-package in Debian 
GNU/Linux)
<h2>Configuration word for PIC16F627A/628A/648A</h2>
bit 13 FLASH Program Memory Code Protection bit: '1' = protection 
off<br>
bit 8 CPD: Data Code Protection bit: '1' = protection off<br>
bit 7 LVP: Low Voltage Programming Enable: '0' = off<br>
bit 6 BOREN: Brown-out Reset Enable bit: '1' = on<br>
bit 5 MCLRE: RA5/MCLR pin function select: '0' = "0 = RA5/MCLR pin 
function is digital Input, MCLR internally tied to VDD"<br>
bit 3 /PWRTEN: Power-up Timer Enable bit: '0' = on<br>
bit 2: WDTEN: Watchdog Timer Enable bit: '1' = on<br>
bit 4, 1-0: FOSC2:FOSC0: Oscillator Selection bits = 100 "INTOSC 
oscillator: I/O function on RA6/OSC2/CLKOUT pin, I/O function on 
RA7/OSC1/CLKIN"<br>
Config word = bin 10000101010100 = hex <b>2154</b><br>
Willem eprom progammer might show this as hex 3154 (bit12 also '1')<br>
Power-up Timer (PWRT) provides
a fixed delay of 72 ms (nominal) on power-up for reset.<br>
"MCLR/RA5" option should be configured as RA5-input.
If, however, the MCLR pin is configured as reset, it is needed 
to tie the pin to +5V voltage level, with a wire link, or a resistor.
The version of the PIC microcontroller I have mostly used is
the PIC16F627A and '628A. PIC16F627/628/627A/628A/648A can be used, 
if you
choose a suitable configuration word for the part you are using.
Please note that the PIC16C84/F84 are 
not usable with these PCB:s, because those controllers require external 
oscillator components. See the original ps2m.lha on Aminet and/or 
microchip datasheets, if you want to use those '84 parts.

<h2>V0.8 for Atari ST</h2>
Cross-swapping signals for pins 1 and 4 at D9 connector
makes Atari ST mouse from Amiga mouse. This pcb wires the PIC to D9 for 
ST use. It was noticed that the mouse pointer moves rather slowly in the
 sense that long move on table has to be made in order the pointer reach
 other end on the display.<br>

<h2>V2.1</h2>

This version was made in order to make use of a right-angled D-9F 
connector with especially long body. I had about 50 pcs of these
connectors, which are used to build this pcb version of the adapter.
Signals needed for mouse scroll functions are not present except at 
the PIC pins, not at any connector. Middle mouse button might work 
except maybe on some A1200:s.
<br>
It might not fit in A600's mouse connector hole or some Atari-ST 
model. The firmware should be the modified version for boosted 
current for right mouse button (ps2m-m03). The soic-18 PIC needs to 
be programmed before soldering on the 
board. The PCB has an option to cris-cros signals to select
between Amiga or Atari-ST operation. It's done by putting
two solder blobs between tiny smd pads on the bottom side.
Document revision A adds default connections for Amiga operation.

This is derived from V0.5 boards. The 10-pin header is now
a through hole type instead of SMT-header. The header must
be soldered in a special way: the pins should not stick out
from the lower side surface, because bulges would not allow the PIC
to be soldered. You could put the PCB on a flat surface and press
the pin header as much as it goes, but not more, and the pins are
then not bulging. (Except for the batch of boards I hade made:
The holes are too wide to hold the pins in place by pressure friction.)<br>

<h2>DIL version with Amiga/ST jumpers</h2>
This has the DIL-18 package variant of the PIC, instead of SOIC-18 SMD package. 
Choosing between Amiga or ST compatibility is done by placing
the jumpers either vertically or horizontally, thus cross-switching
certain two signals going to the D9F-connector.<br>
Please note, that there may be newer PCB versions, than this V1.0 board,
for the other PCB variants (such as V0.7)<br>

<h2>Atari ST version 0.6</h2>
Atari STFM version is different from the Amiga version mainly by 
the criss-crossing of 2 signal lines
(pins 1 and 4 on D9 connector). D9F-connector is right angle type,
which may not fit to other models of Atari ST than STFM, because
the sides of the connector extend wider than the mouse hole in some 
Atari ST models.
Revision-A has design rules "relaxed to 10/10 mils." It also has "MCLR" 
pin of the PIC connected to +5V (unlike the initial revision). The PIC is 
meant to be programmed before soldering on this PCB.<br>

<h2>V0.5b/V0.5a/V0.5/V0.4</h2>
These versions are rather similar to each other. V0.5b has different
track routing from the previous, the autorouter was used.<br>

so autorouter was able complete its job.

<h2>A small batch of V0.2 boards</h2>
<a href="http://www.mkl211015.altervista.org/ps2mhiiri627/v02s.jpg">Picture</a> of completed V0.2
and adapters with bug fix modifications and a worn out DIL adapter.
VCC/GND bug corrected manually to the boards.<br>
V0.X series is designed to accept the original PS2M firmware directly,
without modification. I programmed the controllers using "Willem Eprom" 
programmer and a DIL to SOIC converter. The PICs were temporarily 
soldered to the adapter, although only a few of the pins needed to be 
soldered to the adapter.<br>
This version 0.2 is the first try, and it has many bugs.
I had a small batch factory made, but discovered the bugs only after
that.

There are a number of errors:
VCC and GND switched places on D-9 and IDC-10 connectors. Thats bad.
RB6 of PIC not connected to IDC-10 connector because of unconnected 
net due to different signal names on schematic.
For similar reason, VCC not connected on IDC-10 connector.
VCC would have been on the wrong pin anyway.
The name "OSC1/CLKIN" of unused signal is wrong for the pin number
15. See datasheets for correct info.
V0.3 fixed some of the bugs of V0.2, but I haven't actually built
this version. See newest version, if you want to use the board files
to build boards.
